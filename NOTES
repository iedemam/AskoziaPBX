 - zapata reloads aren't all working (restart needed sometimes)
 - zapata kewlstart / loopstart / groundstart options are needed
 - provider / phone status indicators on edit page
 - compact interfaces page into one tabbed page under System
 - interface bridging options
 - extend callgroup support to add delays, sequential groups
 - storage interface (add storage partition for extended capabilities)
 - extended capabilities hooks into the gui
 - new option to log to storage partition
 - add "Dialplan -> Applications" page to map applications
 - multiple MSNs on ISDN, DID/DDI support in general
 - wakeme's new channel technology grab should be tested (not working with zap because ZAP/1)

 - fix extensions_exists
 - fix dialplan_providers.php to save posted config and display correctly when no providers are present
 - complete is_valid_xxx() checks
 - normalize all single var irregularities, maybe even write a cleanup when upgrading to config.xml 1.2
 - AVM cards are broken
 - confirm "Ringing()" behavior/usage on ISDN connections

 - added sqlite cdr module and sqlite extension to php
 - added options BRIDGE to kernel
 - added bsdlabel to m0n0wall files
   - config.inc:96 - disk listing
 - added wlan & bridge options from new M0N0WALL kernel


-----------------

 - gtalk
 - ajaxify logs page
 - dialplan (still needs (de)select all)
 - start returning get_blahs() functions by reference
 _ also, get_blahs() should return arrays with uniqid's as the keys
 - kernel and asterisk modules should only be loaded when needed
 - privacy with voicemail forward
 - followme
 - add iax2 auth options
   - pubkey import
 - get "advanced mode" working
 - provider to provider access with pin code
 - QoS options, such as jitterbuffer and packet types supported
 - testing / performance mode




; --[ jitter buffer ]-------------------------------------------------------------
; All the jitter buffer settings are in milliseconds.
; The jitter buffer works for INCOMING audio - the outbound audio
; will be dejittered by the jitter buffer at the other end.
;
; maxjitterbuffer: a maximum size for the jitter buffer.
; Setting a reasonable maximum here will prevent the call delay
; from rising to silly values in extreme situations; you'll hear
; SOMETHING, even though it will be jittery.
;
; resyncthreshold: when the jitterbuffer notices a significant change in delay
; that continues over a few frames, it will resync, assuming that the change in
; delay was caused by a timestamping mix-up. The threshold for noticing a
; change in delay is measured as twice the measured jitter plus this resync
; threshold.
; Resyncing can be disabled by setting this parameter to -1.
;
; maxjitterinterps: the maximum number of interpolation frames the jitterbuffer
; should return in a row. Since some clients do not send CNG/DTX frames to
; indicate silence, the jitterbuffer will assume silence has begun after
; returning this many interpolations. This prevents interpolating throughout
; a long silence.
;

;maxjitterbuffer=1000
;maxjitterinterps=10
;resyncthreshold=1000

**** Michael, if you add this to the internal context hints will work for
parking spots:

exten => 701,1,ParkedCall(701)
exten => 701,hint,park:701@parkedcalls

Of course you would add an entry for each parking spot.
