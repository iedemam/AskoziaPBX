// iax tos options
- revamp password field to make it a bit friendlier / eliminate auto-complete problems
- make pbx_sort_ functions even more generic...no need for sip_sort_phones etc
- enter dns server via console
- dial timeout options
- single tone voicemails...
- readback numbers should be definable for each of the incoming extensions
- deleting a provider breaks external phones...warn? suggest?
- "forget" interface details option
- set a more sensible default for analog phone echo canceller size
- start writing short wiki entries for new features as they are implemented
!! - refactor: sip.conf generator rewritten to produce peer and user entries for providers instead of friend entries
bug: new Russian voicemail translation is missing words upon reception...

storage
- device states: unconfigured, configured, inactive, active, healthy, dirty, clean, mounted, unmounted...?!
- fs options?
- ajax format status bar

general improvements
- better documentation on codec options (passthru esp.)
- all data should be accessed with a function, no more direct $config queries
- multiple vs single displays of a gui element on a page should be generalized, there are 5 wheels here already...
- translation storage should be generalized and combined with help.inc

sooner
- fix extensions_exists
- normalize all single var irregularities, maybe even write a cleanup when upgrading to config.xml 1.2
- confirm "Ringing()" behavior/usage on ISDN connections
- start returning get_blahs() functions by reference
_ also, get_blahs() should return arrays with uniqid's as the keys
- kernel and asterisk modules should only be loaded when needed

later

- time based call routing
- better front panel w/quick access to call logs, etc
- disable/enable options for each provider and phone
- storage interface (add storage partition for extended capabilities)
- extended capabilities hooks into the gui
- new option to log to storage partition
- get "advanced mode" working
- provider / phone status indicators on edit page
- dialplan (still needs (de)select all)
- add iax2 auth options
	- pubkey import
- enable sip/iax/isdn/analog debug options on pbx log page
- extend callgroup support to add delays, sequential groups
- privacy with voicemail forward
- cryptographically verifiable, encryptable config.xmls
- QoS options, such as jitterbuffer and packet types supported
