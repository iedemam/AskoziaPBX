 - add russian prompts, ask about copyright information, needs "auth-thankyou"
 - add better fxo detection
 - fix caller id, and number readback on unreachable extensions
 - fix extensions_exists
 - fix diaplan_providers.php to save posted config and display correctly when no providers are present
 - complete is_valid_xxx() checks
 - normalize all single var irregularities, maybe even write a cleanup when upgrading to config.xml 1.2
 - console display needs fixing, spacing and http(s)/port correction
 - add sip presence state support
 - AVM cards are broken
 - add transfer spacing timeout option

 - extend callgroup support to add delays, sequential groups
 - rework incoming extension to support DID's
 - make "advanced" menu collapsable like "diagnostics"

-----------------

new features
 - followme
 - add iax2 auth options
   - pubkey import

improvements
 - dialplan (still needs (de)select all)
 - improve module population in pbxdev
 - start returning get_blahs() functions by reference
 _ also, get_blahs() should return arrays with uniqid's as the keys
 - kernel and asterisk modules should only be loaded when needed
 - ISDN interfaces for providers and phones should be limited to appropriate choices (NT vs TE
 - storage interface (add storage partition for extended capabilities)
 - extended capabilities hooks into the gui
 - new option to log to storage partition
 - privacy with voicemail forward

Docs:
 - presentation
 - website
 - user documentation

- get "advanced mode" working
- provider to provider access with pin code
- QoS options, such as jitterbuffer and packet types supported
- dialplan as a movable grid
- testing / performance mode
- get indications.conf working



; --[ jitter buffer ]-------------------------------------------------------------
; All the jitter buffer settings are in milliseconds.
; The jitter buffer works for INCOMING audio - the outbound audio
; will be dejittered by the jitter buffer at the other end.
;
; maxjitterbuffer: a maximum size for the jitter buffer.
; Setting a reasonable maximum here will prevent the call delay
; from rising to silly values in extreme situations; you'll hear
; SOMETHING, even though it will be jittery.
;
; resyncthreshold: when the jitterbuffer notices a significant change in delay
; that continues over a few frames, it will resync, assuming that the change in
; delay was caused by a timestamping mix-up. The threshold for noticing a
; change in delay is measured as twice the measured jitter plus this resync
; threshold.
; Resyncing can be disabled by setting this parameter to -1.
;
; maxjitterinterps: the maximum number of interpolation frames the jitterbuffer
; should return in a row. Since some clients do not send CNG/DTX frames to
; indicate silence, the jitterbuffer will assume silence has begun after
; returning this many interpolations. This prevents interpolating throughout
; a long silence.
;

;maxjitterbuffer=1000
;maxjitterinterps=10
;resyncthreshold=1000
