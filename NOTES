fixes
 - is_valid_xxx checks need to be completed!!!
 - need a better way to replace uniqids with names

 - use posted config in dialplan providers instead of making users start all over

improvements
 - dialplan (still needs (de)select all)
 - improve module population in pbxdev
 - figure out DID!!!
 - start returning get_blahs() functions by reference
 _ also, get_blahs() should return arrays with uniqid's as the keys
