\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This subproject of AskoziaPBX was developed for executing performance and stress tests on different Askozia installations.
It was written by Mark Stephan \newline (mark.stephan@askozia.com) during a job as a student assistant in Spring/Summer 2010. 

It was designed to execute three different test types in only one script call. The three existing test types are
``two-party-tests'', ``conference-participants-test'' and ``conference-rooms-test''. Of course, it is also possible
to execute only one or two of these tests. They are described in detail in chapters \ref{sec:two-party-test},
\ref{sec:conf-rooms-test} and \ref{sec:conf-participants-test}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Problem}%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The AskoziaPBX software can be downloaded as a firmware image for embedded systems and as a live cd.
The live cd can be run on every normal computer, so the underlying hardware may have very different
performance (e.g., the same software can handle three, 30 or 300 parallel two-way-calls,
depending on the computer performance). For this reason, we had to develop an algorithm to find out
how capable the current Askozia box is.
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Features}%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The current testsuite supports the following features:

\begin{itemize}
\item completely automated testing of one AskoziaPBX
\item automatic configuration of the AskoziaPBX installations with the needed settings
\item three different types of tests:
	\begin{description}
	\item [two-participants tests] The testsuite establishes a variable number of A-to-B
	(or end-to-end) calls between the AskoziaPBX installation and the system performing the test.
	This test simulates a variable number of normal telephone calls between two parties.
	
	\item [conference rooms tests] The testsuite establishes a variable number of conference rooms
	on the AskoziaPBX installation. Each conference room has three participants.
	This test simulates a variable number of three-way conferences on the AskoziaPBX installation.

	\item [conference participants tests] The testsuite establishes one conference with a variable
	number of participants. This test simulates a conference with many many participants.
	\end{description}
	
\item monitoring of the CPU load of the AskoziaPBX caused by the testcalls
\item downloading the recorded CPU load data
\item interpretation and creation of graphs of the testresults 
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Usage}%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The script can be called from the command line as described below: 

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=true,label=code:script-usage,caption={Script usage} ]
./PERF_TEST <options>
perl PERF_TEST <options>

./PERF_TEST --local-ip=192.168.0.2
    --askozia-ip=192.168.0.1
    --max-two-party-test=30
    (two-participants test with maximal 30 users)

./PERF_TEST --local-ip=192.168.100.20
    --askozia-ip=192.168.100.200
    --max-conference-rooms-test=15
    (conference rooms test with maximal 15 rooms)

./PERF_TEST --local-ip=10.10.10.10
    --askozia-ip=10.10.10.5
    --max-conference-participants-test=40
    (conference participants test with maximal 40 users)

./PERF_TEST --local-ip=192.168.2.100
    --askozia-ip=192.168.2.1
    --max-two-party-test=30
    --max-conference-rooms-test=15
    --max-conference-participants-test=40
    (executes all three different tests sequentially)
\end{lstlisting}

The script's parameters can be classified in three sections: ``Necessary'', ``Optional'' and ``Developers''.
The first two groups are described below, the ``Developers'' parameters are listed in the appendix.
You have to be root to execute this script because \texttt{sipp} reserves port for its connection to Askozia.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Necessary Parameters}%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{description}
\item {\texttt{-{}-local-ip=<IP>}} \newline
The IP-adress of the testcomputer that executes the testscript.
<IP> stands for the address of the network interface connected to the AskoziaPBX.
\newline Default: undefined
\newline Example: \texttt{-{}-local-ip=192.168.0.2}
\end{description}

At least one of these three following parameters is necessary, too:
\begin{description}

\item {\texttt{-{}-max-two-party-test=<number>}}
Defines the maximum number of two-party calls that should be established.
The two-party test begins with one call, increases this number of calls
step-by-step and finishes with the number of calls specified by this parameter.
\newline Default: undefined (no two-way tests)
\newline Example: \texttt{-{}-max-two-party-test=30}

\item {\texttt{-{}-max-conference-rooms-test=<number>}}
Defines the maximum number of three-way conferences that should be established.
The conference-rooms test begins with one three-way conference, adds another one
after a specific time and finishes with the number of three-way conferences
set by this parameter.
\newline Default: undefined (no conference rooms test)
\newline Example: \texttt{-{}-max-conference-rooms-test=15}

\item {\texttt{-{}-max-conference-participants-test}}
Defines the maximum number of participants in the conference-participants test.
There is only one conference room which has only one participant at beginning.
Step-by-step, the number of participants is increased up to the value of this
parameter.
\newline Default: undefined (no conference participants tests)
\newline Example: \texttt{-{}-max-conference-participants-test=40}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Dependencies}%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This script was developed under Linux Mint 8 Helena (\url{http://www.linuxmint.com}).
It is not possible to execute this script on Windows because there were many Linux specific system commands
(like \texttt{kill}, \texttt{killall}, \texttt{which}, \texttt{date}, \texttt{id} and \texttt{ping}) used.

The script has the following dependencies:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Perl v5.10.0 (\url{http://www.perl.org})
	\item gnuplot 4.2 patchlevel 5 (\url{http://www.gnuplot.info})
\end{itemize}
